The Q and I categories have very high correlation. They probably double count the same people, and shouldn't be considered separate categories
 - But why then does the SEIQRDP fit both so well while treating them as separate categories?

The SEIRP model fits the data well, but it suggests that after 20 days, 60%+ of the population is insusceptible. Which doesn't make much sense.
 - But it still fits the data so well. Why?

The parameters for the SEIQRDP model still make a complete period with the SEIR model, but it thinks that at the highest point, 60% of the population is infected.

 The fitted parameters for the SEIR model do not look appripriate, but after 5x the amount of time, still make a complete cycle.
